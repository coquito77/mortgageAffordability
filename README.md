The goal of this analysis is to provide a visualization of how mortgages have taken more of household income in California, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. This issue has created social stresses that may take several years to abate.
To estimate this index, the principal payment was estimated from the average 30-year mortgage rate for the median listing price of a home in California. Then the estimated principal was divided over the monthly household income.
The data source for this analysis is from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis FRED, MEHOINUSCAA672N Annual, Real Median Household Income in California; MEHOINUSARA672N Monthly Housing Inventory: Median Listing Price in California; and MORTGAGE30US Weekly 30-Year Fixed Rate Mortgage Average in the United States
